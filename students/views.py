# since you handle a form submission. You use the CourseEnrollForm form for the
# form_class attribute and also define a course attribute for storing the given Course
# object. When the form is valid, you add the current user to the students enrolled on
# the course.
    

# The get_success_url() method returns the URL that the user will be redirected
# to if the form was successfully submitted. This method is equivalent to the success_
# url attribute. Then, you reverse the URL named student_course_detail.

# course. This way, students will be able to navigate through modules inside a course.
